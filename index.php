                        It seems the delicate calm of yesterday's afternoon was shattered‚Äînot by thunder, but by
                        thundering hooves. What was meant to be a scenic carriage ride through the flowering

                        (repeated many times since): ‚ÄúThey were tangled together like ribbon in a sewing basket. And not
